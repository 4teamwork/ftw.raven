Purpose
=======

This package extends `raven`, the Sentry integration with
a Plone integration wich is not logger based but hooks into
the Zope exception handling.

Be aware that there is already a standard `logging based Zope /
Plone integration for raven <https://docs.getsentry.com/hosted/clients/python/integrations/zope/>`_. You should use the standard implementation unless you
want the exception hook based integration.


Installation and configuration
==============================

- Add the `ftw.raven` package to your dependencies.
- Configure the raven client with environment variables in buildout

Example configuration for buildout:

.. code:: ini

    [instance]
    eggs +=
        ftw.raven
    environment-vars +=
        RAVEN_DSN https://123:456@sentry.local/2


Configuration-Test
==================

You can test your configuration by visiting the view ``raven-test`` on
any context as ``Manager``-user.
This will trigger an exception which should appear in your sentry project.

In JavaScript you can call the function ``raven_test()`` in your javascript
console, which will also trigger an exception.


Release tracking
================

When an exception is reported, the release can be sent along.
A release can either be the version number of a released distribution
(e.g. released on pypi) or the HEAD SHA of a project checkout when the
app is not released on pypi.

Version of a released distribution
----------------------------------

For using a distribution version as release, the environment variable
``RAVEN_PROJECT_DIST`` must contain the name of the distribution, e.g.

.. code:: ini

    [instance]
    environment-vars +=
        RAVEN_PROJECT_DIST my.project


Git SHA of checkout
-------------------

Usually the buildout root is a checkout of the project, thus we need to
configured the ``RAVEN_BUILDOUT_ROOT`` so that the git repository is found:

.. code:: ini

    [instance]
    environment-vars +=
        RAVEN_BUILDOUT_ROOT ${buildout:directory}


Ignored exceptions
==================

By default, not all exceptions are reported, because some exceptions
such as redirects or 404s are not errors but are implemented as exceptions.
Without configuration, the exceptions ``NotFound``, ``Unauthorized``,
``Redirect`` and ``Intercepted``.

Reporting of those exceptions can be enabled by with the environment variable
``RAVEN_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS``:

.. code::

    [instance]
    environment-vars +=
        RAVEN_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS NotFound, Redirect

If you need to disable custom exceptions, you can do that with the environment
variable ``RAVEN_DISABLE_EXCEPTIONS``:

.. code::

    [instance]
    environment-vars +=
        RAVEN_DISABLE_EXCEPTIONS UnimportantError


Report JavaScript errors
========================

In order to be able to report JavaScript-errors, the ``ftw.raven:default``
Generic Setup profile must be installed, which registers a JavaScript
including the raven library and the configuration.


Additional tags
===============

It is possible to report additional, predefined tags for a deployment.
The tags may be directly declared as JSON in the environment variable
``RAVEN_TAGS`` or the variable ``RAVEN_TAGS_FILE`` may contain a path
to a json-file.
These two methods may be combined, and the respective dictionaries will
be merged (with tags from the ``RAVEN_TAGS`` variable taking precedence).

The JSON must be a one-level hash containing strings as keys and values.

Examples:

.. code::

    [instance]
    environment-vars +=
        RAVEN_TAGS {"deployment": "production"}

.. code::

    [instance]
    environment-vars +=
        RAVEN_TAGS_FILE ${buildout:directory}/conf/raven_tags.json
